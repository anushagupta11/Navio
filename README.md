This project, conceptualized during the SIH Hackathon, aimed to address common issues in map applications, such as limited offline access, outdated information, battery drain, and unreliable traffic data. 
Our proposed solutions included offline maps for use without internet, real-time traffic updates, a simplified mode to save battery, and region-specific maps for local accuracy. While still in the concept stage, the project focused on creating a more reliable and user-friendly mapping experience.
